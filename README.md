# Simple_Hotel_Program
The Hotel Program is designed to manage a hotel with eight rooms using different programming paradigms. Initially implemented using arrays, the program allows users to view all rooms, add customers to rooms, display empty rooms, delete customers, find rooms by customer name, store and load data from files, and view guests alphabetically. It then extends to a class-based version using Room and Hotel classes, adding features like guest count and guest details. Finally, it incorporates a waiting list using a circular queue for overflow handling. These versions enhance maintainability and functionality by encapsulating data and operations within classes and utilizing data structures like queues for efficient management.
